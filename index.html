Hello,
<br><br>
Recently, I realized that every morning I was feeling incomplete, because I wasn't seeing enough chicken pictures.
<br><br>
I knew that I wasn't alone in this craving, so I decided to create Chicken A Day.
<br><br>
If you sign up, every morning you will wake up to a marvelous chicken picture in your inbox that has been selected with care by my automated system from the endless reserve of chicken pictures on Flickr.
<br><br>
Sign up, and go to bed every night secure in the knowledge that there will be a chicken waiting for you in the morning (or some other time, depending on where you live).
<br><br>

<br><br>
Enjoy,
<br><br>
Daniel
